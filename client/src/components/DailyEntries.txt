  DayEntries
First I created components folder called components.
The root components holds all component
Next I added files , the parents components holds 5 children components(Header, footers,pomodoro,todoContainer, layoutContainer)
Since app.js is in used , i split and decompose the compomnent into smaller unit,  anotherparent component(roots component label LayoutContainer). LayoutContainer renders all the contents/customer componensts
The headers renders the header contents, footers componets render footer ,pomodoro componets render pomodoro contents.
Header in src components folder, renders header comopents, which also renders the pages(Home,Walkthrough,Featues and Logins)
inside header.js i add my route  link 
next i added footer
